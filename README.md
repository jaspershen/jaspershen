## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Xiaotao Shen.

## ðŸ‘¤ About me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Prof. Michael Snyderâ€™s lab at Stanford University School of Medicine. My overarching research interests are bioinformatics algorithms development for multi-omics data, and their application to precision medicine. Specifically, I am interested in bioinformatics algorithm development, including 1) Comprehensive analysis workflow and deep learning for LC-MS data, 2) Metabolic network analysis, 3) Wearable and multi-omics data integration, and 4) microbiome and metabolome data integration. I also employed the developed bioinformatics algorithms as a unique systems biology approach to study the potential biomarkers and mechanisms of 1) pregnancy and related diseases, 2) aging and related diseases, and 3) cancer. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Stanford School of Medicine as a postdoc.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about metabolomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and systems biology.
